## KMP

The string matching problem also known as “the needle in a haystack” is one of the classics. This simple problem has a lot of application in the areas of Information Security, Pattern Recognition, Document Matching, Bioinformatics (DNA matching) among others. Finding a linear time algorithm was a challenge, then came Donald Knuth and Vaughan Pratt conceiving a linear time solution in 1970 by thoroughly analyzing the naive approach. It was also independently discovered by James Morris in the same year. The three published the paper jointly in 1977 and from that point on it is known as the Knuth-Morris-Pratt aka KMP Algorithm.
